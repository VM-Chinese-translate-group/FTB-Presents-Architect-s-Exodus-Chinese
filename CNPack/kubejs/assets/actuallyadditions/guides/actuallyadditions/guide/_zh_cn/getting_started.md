  This page covers the basics of getting started with Actually Additions and some of its systems like crystal crafting and some key machines you will need early on.

  <ItemImage id="black_quartz" />
  <Column>
    Black Quartz generates underground as ores in most dimensions, as Geore Nodes in <Color id="aqua">Jotunheim</Color>, or from certain ore generators like occultism miners. It is one of the primary crafting components in Actually Additions.

  ## <Color id="gold">Atomic Reconstruction</Color>
</Column>

The <Color id="green"><ItemLink id="atomic_reconstructor"/></Color> is the first of two core machines used in Actually Additions. It shoots a laser beam that converts items and blocks placed or dropped in front of it when supplied with power (<Color id="red">1,000 CF or FE </Color> per shot)

Among these conversions are 6 types of crystals used in most early-game and mid-game Actually Additions recipes:

<ItemGrid>
  <ItemIcon id="restonia_crystal" />
  <ItemIcon id="palis_crystal" />
  <ItemIcon id="diamatine_crystal" />
  <ItemIcon id="void_crystal" />
  <ItemIcon id="emeradic_crystal" />
  <ItemIcon id="enori_crystal" />
</ItemGrid>

Right-click the Atomic Reconstructor with a <ItemLink id="minecraft:redstone_torch" /> to toggle between deactivated-by-redstone and pulse modes. This allows you to set up a very early automation using a pressure plate on top of or next to the Atomic Reconstructor and dropping items on it.

The Atomic Reconstructor can also be fitted with <ItemImage id="actuallyadditions:lens" scale="0.5" /> [Lenses](actuallyadditions:lenses.md) to change or enhance its beam behaviors.

<Column alignItems="center" fullWidth={true}>
  ## <Color id="gold">Empowerer</Color>
</Column>

The <Color id="green"><ItemLink id="empowerer"/></Color> is the second core machine used in Actually Additions. It is used to empower crystals into stronger versions. Place the item to empower on the Empowerer block, then place the 4 required catalyst on <ItemLink id="display_stand" /> blocks positioned exactly 3 blocks away in each cardinal direction. The Display Stands need CF or FE power to perform the empowerment.

### <Color id="aqua">Empowerer Setup</Color>

You will also need 4 <Color id="dark_green"><ItemLink id="display_stand" />s</Color> provided with energy to finish setting up your <Color id="green"><ItemLink id="empowerer"/></Color>. They must be placed 3 blocks away from the Display stand as seen on the diagram below.

To craft with this setup you will need to place the main crystal on the Empowerer, while the other resources should be placed around it on top of the <Color id="dark_green"><ItemLink id="display_stand" />s</Color>.

> <Color id="yellow">Tip</Color>: Empowering entire crystal blocks at once is cheaper than individual ingots as both recipes consume the same amount of extra resources.

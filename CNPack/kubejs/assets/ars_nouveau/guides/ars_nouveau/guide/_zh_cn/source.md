  <ItemImage id="source_jar" scale="2" />

  Source is the magical energy that powers all of Ars Nouveau's devices, from the Imbuement Chamber to the Enchanting Apparatus. Gather it with Sourcelinks, store it in Source Jars, and transport it with Relays.

<Row>
  <ItemImage id="source_jar" />
  ### <Color id="aqua">Source Jar</Color>
</Row>

Source Jars store Source generated from nearby Sourcelinks. Many blocks and recipes require Source to function, so you will need both a way to generate it and a way to store it. Place a Source Jar near any Sourcelink and it will fill over time.

Jars retain their stored Source when broken. A comparator placed next to a Source Jar outputs a signal based on its fill level.

  <ItemImage id="sourceberry_bush" />
  ### <Color id="aqua">Sourceberry</Color>
</Row>

Crafted using <CommandLink command="/guideme open @s bloodmagic:guide bloodmagic:crafting.md" title="Open GuideMe Page" close={true}><Color id="red">Blood Magic Alchemy Arrays</Color></CommandLink>, <ItemLink id="sourceberry_bush" /> Bushes drop Sourceberries when harvested. Eating a Sourceberry grants <Color id="green">Mana Regen</Color> for a few seconds.

These can also be used to make Mana Regen potions.

  <ItemImage id="dominion_wand" />
  ### <Color id="aqua">Dominion Wand</Color>
</Row>

The Dominion Wand is the essential tool for configuring Source Relays, automation creatures, and other magical connections. Use it on the source block, then on a target block to create a connection. Sneak-use on a block to clear its connections. Sneak-use in the air to switch to <Color id="green">Strict mode</Color>, which lets you specify the exact side of a block to connect. The wand is also used to control Familiars.

  ## <Color id="gold">Sourcelinks</Color>
</Column>

<ItemImage id="minecraft:air" scale="0.25"/>

Sourcelinks generate Source from various activities in the world. Place them near a <ItemLink id="source_jar" /> to automatically fill it.

None of them are realm gated, and all five share the same crafting table pattern: two gold ingots and two <ItemLink id="source_gem" />s around a single item that defines what the link feeds on. That makes Source generation available as soon as you can produce Source Gems.

<ItemImage id="minecraft:air" scale="0.25"/>

<Row>
  <ItemImage id="volcanic_sourcelink" />
  ### <Color id="aqua">Volcanic Sourcelink</Color>
</Row>

Generates Source from burnable items like Coal or Logs, either dropped nearby or placed on pedestals. Archwood Logs produce bonus Source, with <Color id="green">Blazing Archwood</Color> generating the most.

As it produces Source, the Volcanic Sourcelink generates heat, converting stone blocks within a 3x3 area into Magma Blocks and eventually Lava. If the Lava is uncovered, a <Color id="red">Lava Lily</Color> forms on top.

<ItemImage id="minecraft:air" scale="0.25"/>

<Row>
  <ItemImage id="agronomic_sourcelink" />
  ### <Color id="aqua">Agronomic Sourcelink</Color>
</Row>

Generates Source from crop and tree growth within <Color id="green">15 blocks</Color>. Magical plants such as Mageblooms, Source Berry Bushes, and Archwood Saplings grant bonus Source. Generated Source is deposited into Source Jars within 5 blocks. <Color id="yellow">Note:</Color> Bonemealing does not count as growth for Source generation.

<ItemImage id="minecraft:air" scale="0.25"/>

<Row>
  <ItemImage id="vitalic_sourcelink" />
  ### <Color id="aqua">Vitalic Sourcelink</Color>
</Row>

Generates Source from mob deaths and animal breeding nearby. Also passively generates Source from baby animals in the area, and accelerates their growth.

<ItemImage id="minecraft:air" scale="0.25"/>

<Row>
  <ItemImage id="alchemical_sourcelink" />
  ### <Color id="aqua">Alchemical Sourcelink</Color>
</Row>

Generates Source by consuming potions from adjacent Potion Jars. More complex potions produce more Source, its duration and level each increase the yield, with multipliers for each effect a potion contains. Automate with <Color id="green">Wixies</Color> for a self-sustaining Source supply.

<ItemImage id="minecraft:air" scale="0.25"/>

<Row>
  <ItemImage id="mycelial_sourcelink" />
  ### <Color id="aqua">Mycelial Sourcelink</Color>
</Row>

Generates Source from nearby food items, with a bonus based on the food's nourishment value. <Color id="green">Source Berry</Color> food generates more than non-magical alternatives. Feed it using nearby pedestals.

As a side effect, it converts Grass and Dirt in the 3x3 below it into Mycelium and grows mushrooms in nearby empty spaces.

<ItemImage id="minecraft:air" scale="0.25"/>

<Row>
  <ItemImage id="starbunclemania:fluid_sourcelink" />
  ### <Color id="aqua">Fluid Sourcelink</Color>
</Row>

Generates Source from fluids. It will automatically drain from tanks below it if they are compatible (check JEI for a full list of fluids).

Added by the Starbuncle Mania addon.

  ## <Color id="gold">Source Relays</Color>
</Column>

<ItemImage id="minecraft:air" scale="0.25"/>

Source Relays transport Source between jars and devices. Use the <ItemLink id="dominion_wand" /> to create connections: use the wand on the source block, then use it on the target. Sneak-use the wand on a Relay to clear its connections. Relays have a default range of <Color id="green">30 blocks</Color>.

- **Relay** - Basic Source transport between linked points within 30 blocks.
- **Collector Relay** - Automatically pulls Source from unlinked Source Jars within 5 blocks.
- **Deposit Relay** - Automatically deposits Source into unlinked Source Jars within 5 blocks. Ideal for Source storage rooms.
- **Splitter Relay** - Splits Source to multiple destinations at once with higher throughput than a standard Relay.
- **Warp Relay** - Teleports Source to other Warp Relays at any distance, but transfers beyond 30 blocks have a chance to lose some Source.

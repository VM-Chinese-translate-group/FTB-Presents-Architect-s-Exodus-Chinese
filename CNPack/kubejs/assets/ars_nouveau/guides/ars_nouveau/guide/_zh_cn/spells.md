  Spells in Ars Nouveau are built from modular Glyphs arranged in a chain. Understanding the glyph system is key to mastering magic.

To create a spell, hold a Spell Book and press <Color id="green"><KeyBind id="key.ars_nouveau.open_book" /></Color> (Default: C) to open the spell crafting menu. Every spell starts with a <Color id="aqua">Form</Color> which determines how the spell is delivered. Select <Color id="green">Projectile</Color> as the form, then add an <Color id="aqua">Effect</Color> like <Color id="green">Harm</Color> to define what the spell does. Name your spell and click Save.

The mana cost is displayed at the bottom of the menu. On the right side, numbered slots store your saved spells. On the left, you can change spell colors and adjust settings.

Try using your new spell in the world. Many useful Effects live in Tier 2, and to reach them you need the Apprentice Spell Book, which is crafted in a normal crafting table from your Novice book. Harder blocks like Obsidian additionally require <Color id="green">Augments</Color> to strengthen the spell. You can learn new Glyphs at the [Scribe's Table](getting_started.md), or from a Codex Glyph earned in the quest book.

Every spell starts with a <Color id="green">Form</Color> glyph that determines how the spell is delivered. After the Form, add <Color id="green">Effect</Color> glyphs to define what the spell does, and <Color id="green">Augment</Color> glyphs to modify the behavior.

- <ItemLink id="glyph_projectile" /> - Fires a spell projectile forward
- <ItemLink id="glyph_touch" /> - Applies spell on contact
- <ItemLink id="glyph_self" /> - Casts on yourself
- <ItemLink id="glyph_underfoot" /> - Casts at the block below you

<ItemImage id="minecraft:air" scale="0.25"/>

After the Form glyph, add Effect glyphs such as Break, Harm, Heal, Ignite, Freeze, and many more. Then augment them with Amplify, Extend Time, AOE, Pierce, and other modifiers to customize the spell further.

Glyphs are organized into three tiers, each requiring its corresponding spell book tier or higher.

### <Color id="aqua">Tier 1 - Basic Effects</Color>

Harm, Harvest, Ignite, Freeze, Light, Snare, Launch, Pull, Pickup, Place Block, Crush, Conjure Water, and more. These are the foundation of your spell arsenal.

### <Color id="aqua">Tier 2 - Advanced Effects</Color>

AOE, Heal, Grow, Smelt, Explosion, Cold Snap, Gravity, Fortune, Exchange, Invisibility, Wind Shear, and more. These provide much greater versatility and power.

### <Color id="aqua">Tier 3 - Powerful Effects</Color>

Lightning, Blink, Wither, Hex, Fangs, Summon Undead/Vex/Decoy, Glide, Wall, Linger, Split, Burst, and more. These are the most potent glyphs available, capable of devastating effects.

<ItemImage id="minecraft:air" scale="0.25"/>

<Color id="yellow">Two glyphs are missing from this pack.</Color> <Color id="red">Break</Color> and <Color id="red">Rewind</Color> have no recipe and are hidden from JEI, so they cannot be scribed or rolled from a Codex.

Losing Break means Ars Nouveau has no general purpose mining spell here. The narrower block glyphs all still work: <Color id="green">Harvest</Color> for crops, <Color id="green">Fell</Color> for trees, <Color id="green">Cut</Color> for leaves and plants, and <Color id="green">Crush</Color> for turning stone into gravel and gravel into sand. For actual excavation, reach for a mining tool or another mod.

Crush and Conjure Water have both been moved down to Tier 1 here, so they are available from your Novice book.

  ### <Color id="aqua">Spell Parchment</Color>
</Row>

Spells can be inscribed onto <Color id="green">Spell Parchment</Color> at the Scribe's Table for use beyond your spell book.

Spell Parchment is used in several important ways:

- <Color id="green">Spell Turrets</Color> - Automate spell casting with turrets that fire inscribed spells
- <Color id="green">Reactive Enchantment</Color> - Apply spells to equipment that trigger on specific events
- <Color id="green">Runic Chalk</Color> - Create spell-casting runes on the ground

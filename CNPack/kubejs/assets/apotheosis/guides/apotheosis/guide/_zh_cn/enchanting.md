  Apotheosis completely overhauls Minecraft's enchanting system. The vanilla level 30 cap is removed, shelves can push enchanting power up to level 100, and five new stats govern how your enchanting table behaves.

  ## <Color id="gold">Enchanting Stats</Color>
</Column>

These are the five stats added to the enchanting table by Apotheosis (hover over the enchanting UI to see your current values):

- <Color id="aqua">Eterna</Color> — The primary stat, increasing the maximum enchanting level by 1 with each point. Standard bookshelves provide Eterna up to level 30; [Specialized shelves](enchanting/shelves.md) push it further.
- <Color id="aqua">Quanta</Color> — Controls variance. Your base enchanting power is multiplied by a random value between (1 - Quanta) and (1 + Quanta). Higher Quanta means bigger swings; you might get amazing results or terrible ones.
- <Color id="aqua">Arcana</Color> — Controls enchantment rarity weights and bonus enchantments. Default rarity weights are Common 10, Uncommon 5, Rare 3, Very Rare 1. Every 10% of Arcana shifts these weights toward rarer results. At 25% Arcana you are guaranteed at least 2 enchantments, and at 75% you get at least 3.
- <Color id="aqua">Rectification</Color> — Improves the lower bound of the Quanta roll. This makes your results more consistently good without reducing the upper bound. Higher is always better.
- <Color id="aqua">Clues</Color> — Each point reveals one additional enchantment in the enchanting table preview window, letting you make more informed decisions.

  ## <Color id="gold">Tomes & Scrapping</Color>
</Column>

<Color id="aqua">Tomes</Color> are specialized books that only receive certain types of enchantments when used at the enchanting table, letting you target weapon, armor, or tool enchantments specifically.

<Row>
  <ItemImage id="scrap_tome" />
  ### <Color id="aqua">Scrapping Tomes</Color>
</Row>

Scrapping Tomes extract enchantments from items when combined in an anvil:

- <Color id="gold">Basic Scrapping Tome:</Color> Recovers half of the item's enchantments. Destroys the item.
- <Color id="gold">Superior Scrapping Tome:</Color> Recovers all enchantments. Destroys the item.
- <Color id="gold">Extraction Tome:</Color> Recovers all enchantments and keeps the item intact.

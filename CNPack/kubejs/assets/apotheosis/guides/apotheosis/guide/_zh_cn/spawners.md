  ## <Color id="gold">Spawner Stats</Color>
</Column>

Spawner stats are changed by right-clicking the spawner while holding a modifier item. Each modifier adjusts one or more stats and has a cap on how many times it can be applied.

All spawner modifiers and their effects are visible in <Color id="aqua">JEI</Color> — search for "Spawner Modifier" to see the full list.

Once placed, spawners can be configured and upgraded by applying modifier items directly to them. Every spawner has configurable stats that control its behavior:

* <Color id="aqua">Min Spawn Delay</Color> — The minimum time (in ticks) between spawn attempts.
* <Color id="aqua">Max Spawn Delay</Color> — The maximum time (in ticks) between spawn attempts.
* <Color id="aqua">Spawn Count</Color> — How many mobs are spawned per activation.
* <Color id="aqua">Max Nearby Entities</Color> — The spawner stops working if this many of its mob type are already nearby.
* <Color id="aqua">Activation Range</Color> — How close a player must be for the spawner to activate.
* <Color id="aqua">Spawn Range</Color> — The horizontal radius in which mobs can appear.

The following toggles can also be applied:

* <Color id="aqua">Ignores Players</Color> — Spawner runs even without a player nearby.
* <Color id="aqua">Ignores Conditions</Color> — Ignores vanilla spawn condition checks (light level, block type, etc.).
* <Color id="aqua">Redstone Control</Color> — Spawner only runs when receiving a redstone signal.
* <Color id="aqua">Ignores Light</Color> — Ignores light level requirements for spawning.
* <Color id="aqua">No AI</Color> — Spawned mobs have no AI. Highly recommended for mob farms as it significantly reduces server load.

  ## <Color id="gold">Capturing Enchantment</Color>
</Column>

<Color id="aqua">Capturing</Color> is a sword enchantment that gives mobs a chance to drop their spawn egg on death. The chance is <Color id="red">0.4% per enchantment level</Color>.

Use the dropped spawn egg on a spawner by right-clicking to change the spawner's entity type. This is the primary method for creating spawners of specific mob types.
